    <h2>Tuna Salad</h2>
    <p>Source: <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-tuna-salad-sandwich-recipe">https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-tuna-salad-sandwich-recipe</a></p>
    <p>Classic in every way, but with a couple of subtle twists to amp up its flavor and texture, the tuna salad on these sandwiches is packed with bits of celery, rapid-pickled red onion, parsley, and a small dose of fish sauce (or anchovy) for a deeper, more savory flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium red onion (about 8 ounces; 225g), cut into 1/4-inch dice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>4 (5-ounce; 140g) cans oil-packed tuna, drained</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery (about 6 ounces; 170g total), cut into 1/4-inch dice</li>
        <li>1 cup (240ml) mayonnaise, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>1 ounce (about 10 stalks) flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems, minced (about 1/4 packed cup)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon (3g) Asian fish sauce or very finely minced oil-packed anchovy fillets (about 2 small fillets)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>8 slices sandwich bread, very lightly toasted</li>
        <li>Romaine lettuce leaves, torn, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine onion and vinegar (vinegar should just cover onion; add more if it does not) and let stand 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine tuna and mayonnaise and mix very well with a spoon until tuna is reduced to very small shreds.</li>
        <li>Drain onion well, then add to tuna along with celery, parsley, and fish sauce or anchovy. Mix until well incorporated, then season with salt and pepper. Add more mayo, 1 tablespoon at a time, if desired.</li>
        <li>Spoon tuna salad onto 4 bread slices, top with lettuce leaves, then close sandwiches. Serve right away.</li>
    </ol>
